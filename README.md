# 2nd Order Differential Equation Solver

Skills: Huffman Coding, Op-Amps, OrCAD

- I am Mehul Kumar Sahoo pursuing B.Tech in Electronics Engineering at IIT(BHU), Varanasi.
- I have made an analog circuit using OpAmps to solve a second order differential equation whose coefficients were encoded using Huffman Encoding.

## Explanation of the Problem Statement
- We have been given the following differential equation

- We have been provided with the values of k1 and k2 in form of Huffman codes

- The probability of occurance of each letter of English alphabet is given as follows:

- The initial conditions (t=0) of the differntial Equations are as follows:

## Solution to the Problem Statement
- I have proposed the following circuit as the solution:

- We are getting the following output waveform from the circuit:
